# Computer Store Management System
This program was created as part of an assignment for a second-year (2022) Computer Science paper at Massey University. 

<br/>

## About the Assignment
A management system is required to view the computers carried by the store (found in the computers.txt file).

<br/>

## Requirements (summarized from the assignment specifications)

- There should be two types of users: Salesperson and Manager. A manager can create, edit, view, and delete products. A salesperson may only view products.
- Users should have to log in before using the system.
- Computers can be searched by category and type.
- A GUI is required to use the program.

<br/>

If using the command line, locate the src folder and then run:
1. javac Main.java
2. java Main.java

When logging in, a username and password are required. For testing purposes both the username and password are the same.
The three salesperson IDs are p1, p2, and p3.
The two manager IDs are m1, and m2.
The accounts can be changed in the Staff.java file.
